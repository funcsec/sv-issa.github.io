The Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) is a not-for-profit, international organization of information security professionals and practitioners. It provides educational forums, publications and peer interaction opportunities that enhance the knowledge, skill and professional growth of its members.

Our chapter is comprised of over 250 Silicon Valley Information Security Staff, Consultants, Managers, Executives, and other business professionals. Our members come from Small Businesses and Fortune 100 companies. Our demographics are diverse, yet we share the common thread that we understand the criticality of Information Security as an enabler of today's key business objectives and the improvements that will come tomorrow.
